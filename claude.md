## Key Features

### AI Skin Analysis (3-Angle Capture)
- **Multi-angle photo capture**: Front, left profile, right profile
- Guided camera interface with face positioning overlay
  - Step-by-step capture flow with progress indicators
  - Angle-specific instructions and tips
  - 3-second countdown timer for each capture
  - Review screen with retake option per angle
- Claude AI analyzes all three angles for comprehensive assessment
- Detects: fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, acne, dryness, oiliness, redness, dullness, large pores, uneven texture, dark circles, dehydration
- Smart fallback with varied results if AI unavailable
- All 3 images (front, left, right) stored compressed in database

### Anthropic API Capabilities
The skin analysis uses advanced Anthropic Claude API features:

- **Prompt Caching** (enabled by default): Caches system prompts for ~90% token cost reduction
  - System prompts marked with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`
  - Cache metrics logged for monitoring
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_PROMPT_CACHING`

- **Streaming** (opt-in): Real-time analysis feedback via SSE
  - Endpoint: `/api/skin-analysis/analyze-stream`
  - Hook: `useStreamingAnalysis()`
  - Component: `StreamingAnalysisView`
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_STREAMING=true`

- **Tool Use** (opt-in): Dynamic product lookup during analysis
  - Tools: `lookup_products`, `check_ingredient_compatibility`, `build_routine`, `get_ingredient_benefits`
  - Enables Claude to query database and build personalized routines
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_TOOL_USE=true`

- **Extended Thinking** (opt-in): Deep reasoning for complex cases
  - Triggered for users with 3+ previous analyses or 4+ conditions
  - Uses thinking budget of 10k tokens for step-by-step reasoning
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_EXTENDED_THINKING=true`

- **Unified Analyzer**: Intelligently selects best method based on context
  - Import: `import { analyzeSkin } from '@/lib/skin-analysis/unified-analyzer'`
  - Auto-selects: standard, tool-use, or extended-thinking

- **Image Preprocessing** (enabled by default): Normalizes images before AI analysis
  - Auto white balance correction
  - Exposure normalization
  - Contrast enhancement
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING`

### Image Quality System
- **Pre-analysis validation**: Checks images before sending to AI
  - Resolution (minimum 400x400)
  - Brightness (detects too dark < 40, overexposed > 220)
  - Contrast (ensures facial features visible, minimum 20)
- **Critical issue blocking**: API returns 400 error for unusable images
  - Too dark → "Please take photos in a well-lit area"
  - Overexposed → "Please avoid direct bright light sources"
  - Low resolution → "Please use a higher quality camera setting"
  - User sees detailed error with tips for retaking photos
- **Non-critical issues**: Minor contrast issues logged but analysis proceeds
- **Server-side preprocessing**: Uses Sharp library to normalize images
  - Corrects white balance for consistent skin tone detection
  - Normalizes exposure regardless of lighting conditions
  - Enhances contrast for better feature detection
- **QualityIndicator component**: Real-time feedback during camera capture
  - Live brightness meter
  - Quality badge (Excellent/Good/Acceptable/Poor)
  - Actionable warnings for issues

### Smart Auto-Capture
- **Live camera with quality monitoring**: `useLiveCamera` hook
  - Continuous quality assessment during video preview
  - Frame burst capture (3 frames at 200ms intervals)
  - Automatic best-frame selection based on quality score
- **Face detection**: Browser FaceDetector API with fallback
  - Detects face position and provides guidance
  - "Move closer", "Center your face", "Move left/right" feedback
  - Skin-tone heuristics for browsers without FaceDetector API
- **Auto-capture trigger**: Captures when conditions are optimal
  - Quality score above threshold (default: 70)
  - Face well-positioned in frame
  - Stable for 1.5 seconds (configurable)
  - Circular progress indicator shows countdown
- **LiveCameraCapture component**: Drop-in smart camera
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_SMART_AUTO_CAPTURE`
  - Falls back to manual capture if disabled
- **Camera permission fallback**: Upload mode when camera access denied
  - Shows helpful error message with browser settings guidance
  - "Upload Photo Instead" button switches to file upload mode
  - Full 3-angle workflow preserved with file picker
  - "Try Camera Again" option to retry camera access

### Dual Scoring System
- **Skin Age**: Estimated biological skin age based on aging indicators
  - Fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, dullness add years to skin age
  - Shows "Current: 38 → Achievable: 33" with 5-8 year improvement potential
  - Improvement is calculated based on reversibility of detected conditions
- **Skin Quality**: 0-100 score for overall skin health
  - Based on non-aging conditions (acne, oiliness, redness, pores, etc.)
  - Category breakdowns: hydration, clarity, texture, radiance
- Enables targeted product recommendations:
  - Anti-aging products for skin age concerns
  - Treatment products for skin quality concerns

### Skincare Goals (Personalized Scoring)
Users choose their skincare ambition level, which adjusts how strictly their skin is scored:

- **Age Normally** 🌿 (1.5x multiplier)
  - Relaxed scoring for those accepting natural aging gracefully
  - Target score: ~70 for typical conditions

  - Tagline: "Glow at every age"

- **Stay Young Forever** 💎 (2.5x multiplier)
  - Ambitious scoring for anti-aging perfectionists
  - Target score: ~50 for typical conditions
  - Tagline: "Defy time itself"

**Implementation:**

DATABASE_URL=           # PostgreSQL connection string
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=      # Claude API for skin analysis
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=  # Vercel Blob for image storage
SESSION_SECRET=         # Secret for signing session tokens (required in production)

# Shopify Integration (optional - for auto-sync discount codes)

## Shopify Discount Code Integration

The growth hacking system generates discount codes that need to work on the Shopify checkout. There are two integration modes:

### Option A: Automatic Sync (Recommended)
When `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` and `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` are configured:
- Discount codes are automatically created in Shopify when generated
- Uses Shopify Admin API to create price rules and discount codes
- Sync status tracked in database (`shopifySynced`, `shopifyPriceRuleId`, `shopifyDiscountCodeId`)

To set up:
1. Go to Shopify Admin → Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps
2. Create a new app with Admin API access
3. Grant `write_price_rules` and `read_price_rules` scopes
4. Copy the Admin API access token
5. Set `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=ayonne.myshopify.com` (your .myshopify.com domain)
6. Set `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxx`

### Option B: Manual Export
If Shopify API is not configured, use the admin export endpoint:
- `GET /api/admin/discounts/export` - Download CSV of unsynced codes
- Import CSV into Shopify Admin → Discounts → Import

### Admin Endpoints
All require `x-admin-key` header matching `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var:

#### Discount Management

  - Body: `{ codeId: "..." }` for single code
  - Body: `{ syncAll: true }` for all unsynced codes
- `GET /api/admin/discounts/export` - Export as CSV
  - Query params: `format=csv|json`, `status=unsynced|synced|active`

#### SEO Management
- `GET /api/admin/seo` - Full SEO audit of all products
  - Query params: `type=audit|products|pages|catalog`, `handle=product-handle`

## Security & Privacy Features

- **Signed session tokens**: HMAC-SHA256 signed cookies prevent forgery
- **Token revocation**: Server-side token invalidation via RevokedToken table
- **Authentication required**: All analysis endpoints require valid session
- **Rate limiting**: 5 analyses per customer per hour
- **Owner verification**: Users can only view their own analyses
- **HTTP-only cookies**: Session tokens not accessible via JavaScript
- **Secure cookies**: HTTPS-only in production
- **Image storage**: Conditional - only stored if user consents (see below)

### Image Storage Consent System

Users control whether their photos are stored for progress tracking:

**Consent States** (`ImageStorageConsent` enum):
- `ALLOWED` - Photos stored in Vercel Blob for progress tracking
- `DENIED` - Photos analyzed but NOT stored (ephemeral)
- `NOT_SET` - Legacy/default state (treated as DENIED for storage)

**Implementation:**
- Consent checkbox in `SignupForm.tsx` (defaults to ALLOWED)
- Privacy Settings toggle in `/account` page
- `canStoreCustomerImages(customerId)` helper in `auth.ts`
- `analyze-multi/route.ts` checks consent before upload
- API: `GET/PATCH /api/account/image-consent`

**Impact When Storage is DENIED:**
- Analysis proceeds normally (images sent to Claude AI temporarily)
- No images stored in Vercel Blob or database
- History page shows analyses without thumbnails
- Skin Forecast face aging preview unavailable
- Progress comparison features limited
- Data export shows `imagesStored: false`

**User Experience:**
- Warning shown when consent is denied explaining feature limitations
- Users can change preference anytime in account settings
- Signup form explains what photo storage enables

### Skin Analyzer Security (Luxury Product Standards)

Multi-layer verification ensures accurate, fraud-resistant analysis:

**Identity Verification** (`identity-verification.ts`)
- Step 0 in Claude prompt verifies same person across all 3 angles
- Compares facial structure, features, skin tone, distinguishing marks
- Rejects if confidence < 70% with error code `IDENTITY_MISMATCH`

**Multiple Face Detection**
- Browser-side: FaceDetector API detects up to 5 faces, rejects if >1
- AI-side: Claude validates face count per image
- Error code: `MULTIPLE_FACES`

**Makeup & Filter Detection**
- Step 0.5 detects heavy makeup and beauty filters
- Beauty filters (>70% confidence) block analysis completely
- Heavy makeup logged as warning but allowed
- Error code: `BEAUTY_FILTER`

**Face Zone Validation**
- Step 0.75 validates critical facial zones are visible
- Front: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth, chin
- Profile: temple, cheek contour, jawline
- Rejects if visibility score < 60%
- Error code: `FACE_ZONES_INCOMPLETE`

**Raised Quality Thresholds**
- Minimum resolution: 800x800 (increased from 640)
- Brightness range: 70-190 (tightened from 60-200)
- Minimum contrast: 35 (increased from 30)
- Minimum sharpness: 150 (increased from 100)
- Overall minimum score: 55 (increased from 40)

**Analysis Disclaimers**
- Medical advice disclaimer included in all responses
- Conservative guidance: err on younger side for age estimates
- Never diagnose medical conditions

### GDPR/Privacy Compliance
- **Account deletion**: DELETE `/api/auth/delete-account` removes all user data
- **Data export**: GET `/api/auth/export-data` provides portable JSON export
- **Logout all devices**: POST `/api/auth/logout-all` revokes all active sessions
- **Data retention**: 90-day image retention, 30-day session tokens
- **Privacy policy**: Updated with skin analysis data handling details
